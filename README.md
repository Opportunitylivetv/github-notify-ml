index.py is a python CGI script that provides a Webhook to be used as a github hook endpoint to send mail to a set of email addresses when specific events (e.g. push, new issues, etc) happen in specific repos.

The set of mailing lists, repos and events is configured in a JSON file, named `mls.json` that lives in the same directory as the webhook, with the following structure:
```json
{
 "email@example.com": {
   "githubaccount/repo": {
      "events": ["issues.opened", "issues.closed", "issue_comment.created", "pull_request.opened", "pull_request.labeled"],
      "eventFilter": {"label":"important"}
      "branches: {
        "master": ["push"]
      }
   }
  },
 "email2@example.com": {

  }
}
```

In other words:
* each email address to which notifications are to be sent is a top level object
* in email objects, each repos from which events need to be notified is an object
* in repo objects, there are 3 potential fields:
  * `events` is an array of Github events applicable to the repo as a whole; only events in that array will be notified
  * `eventFilter` is an optional set of filters that are applied to the events above; at the moment, only a `label` filter is defined, which means that only events that are associated with the said label will be notified
  * `branches` allows to describe events that are applicable at the branch level rather than the whole repo (e.g. "push")

Only events for which templates have been defined (in the `templates/generic` directory) will be notified. Each mail target can have customized templates by creating an `email@example.com` directory in `templates/mls` and having a file named after the event. Templates use Mustache-based pystache as their engines and are fed with payload data from the event. The first line of the template is used as the subject of the email.

In addition to configuring targets of notifications, an instance of this webhook needs to define a `config.json` file with the SMTP host, the address from which messages will be sent, and set a GitHub OAUTH token that can be used to retrieve information via the GitHub API.

## W3C instance
W3C operates an instance of this service for WGs (and some CGs) repositories; if you want to make use of this service, please contact dom@w3.org with the following information:
* mailing list to which notifications should be sent
* name of the repo(s)
* events that should be notified among:
  * creation of issue
  * closure of issue
  * creation of pull request
  * new comment on an issue
  * new push to a branch (and if so, which branch(es))

If you want to use specific text in the notifications, please provide a template as described above.
